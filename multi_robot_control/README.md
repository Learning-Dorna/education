# **Tic-Tac-Toe Automation**

## **Overview**
This project involves using two Dorna TA robots that communicate with each other to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This introduces students to the exciting world of multi-robot automating by creating a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using two Dorna TA robotic arms. Participants will learn how to assemble the robots, configure their communication through I/O pins, and program their movements to autonomously play the game. By integrating robotics, programming, and real-time communication, students will understand how machines can work collaboratively to complete tasks in a structured environment.

Throughout the project, students will write Python scripts to control the robots, handle game logic, and communicate through I/O ports to signal moves and update the game board. The robots will pick and place Tic-Tac-Toe pieces based on board positions, communicating their actions to ensure that both robots know when and where to place pieces. The course emphasizes hands-on learning, enabling students to interact with robots, troubleshoot code, and gain valuable experience in automation.

### **Main Learning Objective: Communication Between Robots**
The primary learning objective of this project is to develop a reliable communication system between two robots to automate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Communication is achieved through the I/O ports on the robots, which transmit signals to indicate game board positions and actions.


**How We Achieve Communication**
<br/>
In this project the robots need to communicate with eachother to know what spaces are avalible and when it is safe for it to make a move. The robots communicate by sending signals through their I/O ports. These signals represent different positions on the game board and instruct the robots on where to place the game pieces.

The I/O ports 1-4 send binary values, which the robots interpret as coordinates on the Tic-Tac-Toe grid. By utilizing a predefined mapping between I/O pin values and board positions, the robots can accurately read the table and make a move based on the game logic. It also uses the pin signal from pin 5 to know when it is safe to make a move. This is done by Robot A setting output pin 5 to equal 1 when it is making a move that action sets input pin 5 on Robot B equal to 1 indicating to Robot B that Robot A is working and it must wait to make a move.

Hereâ€™s the table that defines the communication protocol between the robots:<br>
*Note that the I/O signals are formated [pin 1, pin 2, pin 3, pin 4]*

## **Assembly instructions**

1. **Mount the robots**  
   Follow the [mounting instructions](https://github.com/dorna-robotics/education/tree/main/mount_robot#assembly) to mount both robots.

2. **Attach the suction grippers**  
   Attach the suction grippers to both robots following the [suction gripper instructions](https://github.com/dorna-robotics/education/blob/main/attach_suction_gripper/README.md#assembly).

3. **Connect the base plates**  
   Use the three base plate connectors to join the two base plates on the short edge furthest from the robots.
